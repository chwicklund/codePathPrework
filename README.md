# Pre-work - *Memory Game*

**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: **Charles Wicklund**

Time spent: **1.3** hours spent in total

Link to project: (insert your link here, should start with https://glitch.com...)

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* - [X] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* - [X] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* - [X] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* - [X] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* - [X] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* - [X] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* - [X] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* - [X] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* - [X] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* - [X] Playback speeds up on each turn
* - [X] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/web/javascript/reference/global_objects/math/random

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

  A challenge I encountered was using a programming language I hadn't used before. I programmed with Java 
for a year and a half in high school, but I never touched Javascript. Looking at the code at first was 
daunting, since it was in a language I've never coded in before. I decided to look at the example code in
the tutorial and read the explanations thoroughly to gain a better understanding. After reading through the 
program, I realized that it's just another programming language. The logic all works the same as other 
object-oriented programming languages, it's just basically learning a new syntax. I looked up how to use 
the Javascript Math.random function because I wasn't sure how to call it, but once I had that it was a 
smooth programming experience. I just used the same syntax that I read in the example code when I needed 
to make the extra features. After getting over the "language barrier", it was just like coding in any other 
language. Additionally, I hadn't utilized the Glitch IDE before completing the pre-work. The interface, 
however, is relatively simple when compared to that of more robust development software; so learning it
took a short about of time.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
  
  I have a few questions about web development, coding, and the process as a whole. In web development, how
  do ideas for projects make their way from ideas to implemented features? How do project managers evenly 
  distribute work between team members? Who has final say over what is included in releases? What is the most 
  widely used IDE in the field? Is GitHub used often professionally? 

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

  If I had a few more hours to work on this project, there are a few more additions I would like to make. 
In my submission, I only had enough time to add 2 of the 6 extra features: the decreasing time on the 
pattern hold, and the random pattern generation on program start. The two features I implemented were
two of the easier options on the list, but if I had more time, I would at least attempt to program the 
other optional features. In addition, I would also customize the game page further. I've taken coursework 
with HTML, so building a webpage around the current game would be possible; and it would give the game
page an additional level of polish and refinement.
